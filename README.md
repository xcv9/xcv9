 Hello, I’m tema 
 I’m interested in developing modifications for GTA and building custom PCs.  
 I’m currently learning new ways to optimize mods and improve PC performance.  
 I’m looking to collaborate on GTA mods, PC building tips, and game development projects.  
 How to reach me: You can contact me through GitHub or tg - xcv199. 
 Fun fact: I live in Tel Aviv, Israel, and love exploring new tech trends and gaming modifications.
